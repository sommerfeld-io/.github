# Assets

Collection of assets to use in other projects. The files from this directory are the master versions of the assets.

Normally these assets are downloaded from the internet through a task inside the `tasksfile.yml`.

Reasons for this is to avoid duplicating the same files and workflow definitions in multiple projects.
