Analyze this projects source code by running Qodana.

== Overview

This script performs code and AsciiDoc analysis using Qodana. This script
examines the source code and AsciiDoc files, providing valuable insights and highlighting
potential issues. To support this workflow, a custom Docker image, based on the official
link:https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/qodana[Qodana] Docker image, is utilized. This custom
image includes additional plugins required for accurate analysis of AsciiDoc files,
ensuring thorough code and documentation quality checks.

The script is invoked by the `docs-as-code.yml` workflow. By integrating this script into
the workflow, we ensure that code and documentation quality checks are seamlessly
incorporated into our continuous integration and documentation processes.

=== Script Arguments

* _$1_ (string): Use `--save-report` to run in pipelines. When omitting this option a webserver starts at link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080].
