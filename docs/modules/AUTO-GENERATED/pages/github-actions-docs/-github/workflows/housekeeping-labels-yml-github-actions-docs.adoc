Github Actions workflow that ensures all mandatory labels are present for a repo and all obsolete labels are removed.

== Overview

The workflow, that is called this way, is responsible for deleting unnecessary
labels and creating the required labels for issues and pull requests. By executing this workflow,
it ensures a streamlined and organized labeling system, enabling effective categorization and
tracking of tasks and contributions within your projects. Since the labels are managed through this
workflow, the settings from link:https://github.com/organizations/sommerfeld-io/settings/repository-defaults[GitHub organizations label-config]
don't take effect.

The workflow acts as a self-contained automation for this repository as well as a reusable
workflow module for other repositories. This means that other projects can include this
workflow, enabling a consistent label configuration.
