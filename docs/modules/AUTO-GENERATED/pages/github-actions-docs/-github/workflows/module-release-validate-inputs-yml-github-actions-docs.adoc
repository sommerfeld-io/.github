Github Actions module to call from other workflows.

== Overview

This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to be a reusable workflow that functions
as a component within other workflows. It cannot be triggered on its own but rather acts as
part of larger workflows, specifically those related to "Deploy + Release" (`release.yml`).

The main purpose of this workflow module is to validate the version that should be released,
ensuring it adheres to the rules of semantic versioning. To accomplish this, the module utilizes
the `semver-action`, a tool that enforces semantic versioning rules and checks whether the
proposed version follows the proper format.

When integrated into a "Deploy + Release" workflow, this module serves as a gatekeeper for the
release process. It prevents incorrect or invalid versions from being released and helps maintain
versioning consistency across projects. By centralizing this validation logic into a reusable
workflow, developers can ensure a consistent and reliable release process across different
projects and workflows.
