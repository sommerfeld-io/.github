Github Actions module to call from other workflows.

== Overview

This Reusable Workflow serves as a module that offers essential linter
functionalities which are common to all repositories. This module is designed to be called from
other workflows and never runs independently within the `.github` repository. By including this
reusable workflow in other workflows, developers can easily incorporate common linting
capabilities into their specific workflows, promoting code quality and adherence to predefined
standards. It cannot be triggered on its own but rather acts as part of larger workflows,
specifically those related to "CI" (`ci.yml`).

There is no need to manage the linter rule sets on your own for each repository. The
"Organization Housekeeping: Linter Rules" workflow guarantees that all required linter rule sets
are present and up to date in every repository within the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld.io organisation].
This streamlined approach eliminates the burden of manually managing and updating rule sets in
individual repositories, saving time and promoting code consistency.
