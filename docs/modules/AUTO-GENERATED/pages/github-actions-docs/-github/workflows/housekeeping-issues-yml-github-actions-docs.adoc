Github Actions workflow generates Asciidoc documentation based on source code from this repo and updates the projects README file.

== Overview

The workflow, that is called this way, handles the automatic assignment of newly
created issues and pull requests to specific projects and users. By leveraging this workflow,
tasks and contributions are efficiently tracked and assigned, ensuring clear ownership and
streamlined collaboration within your development projects. It is designed to automatically
trigger whenever new issues or Pull Requests are created.

The workflow acts as a self-contained automation for this repository as well as a reusable
workflow module for other repositories. This means that other projects can include this
workflow, enabling a consistent and automated issue and PR management.
