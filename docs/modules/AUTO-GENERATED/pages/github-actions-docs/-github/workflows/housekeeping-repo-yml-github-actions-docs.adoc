Github Actions workflow that manages the global repository config and that allows to sync linter rule sets into repos.

== Overview

The workflow guarantees a consistent configuration of the repository itself by
automating tasks such as enabling and disabling certain features (e.g., the wiki feature) or
applying specific settings. This ensures that the repository maintains a standardized and
controlled environment, aligning with the desired configuration.

The workflow acts as a self-contained automation for this repository as well as a reusable
workflow module for other repositories. This means that other projects can include this
workflow, enabling a consistent repository configuration.
