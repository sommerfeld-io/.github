Github Actions workflow that manages the global repository config and that allows to sync some commont files into repos (if not already present).

== Overview

The workflow guarantees a consistent configuration of the repository itself by
automating tasks such as enabling and disabling certain features (e.g., the wiki feature) or
applying specific settings. This ensures that the repository maintains a standardized and
controlled environment, aligning with the desired configuration.
