Github Actions to create a new release of this software project (= this repository).

== Overview

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the release process for the software project
hosted in this repository. Its main objective is to create new releases while ensuring consistency
and reliability in the release management.

It automatically creates version tags in the project's repository, based on the `version` input
parameter.

The workflow generates release notes and metadata, which are used to create GitHub releases
associated with the version tags. This helps maintain a clear record of all project releases and
their corresponding changes. However, in case an intro text or description is needed, it must be
added manually after the worflow succeeded.

The workflow also handles artifact deployment, such as publishing Docker images to DockerHub
(including updateing the description on DockerHu8b). This ensures that the released artifacts are
readily available for users or other systems.

It's essential to emphasize that this GitHub Actions workflow is the recommended and only authorized
way to create releases. The workflow is triggered manually through the GitHub UI. All other ways to
create releases are discouraged to maintain a standardized and error-free release process.

By relying on this automated pipeline for releases, the project streamlines its release workflow,
reduces the likelihood of errors, and provides users with access to stable and up-to-date software
versions.
