Github Actions workflow that handles continuous integration tasks like running linters, building the app and running automated tests.

== Overview

This GitHub Actions workflow is designed for continuous integration and automates
essential tasks such as code linting, building the application, and running automated tests.
It ensures code quality, catches errors early, and provides developers with quick feedback on
their changes. The workflow triggers automatically when new code is pushed to the remote repo
and automatically each night, making it an integral part of the development process to maintain
a stable and reliable codebase.
