Github Actions workflow that generates Asciidoc documentation based on source code from this repo and updates the projects README file.

== Overview

This GitHub Actions workflow serves the purpose of generating Asciidoc documentation
based on the source code from the repository and updating the project's `README.adoc` based on
contents from the Antora docs. It is designed to automatically trigger whenever new code is pushed
to the remote repository. Additionally, it is scheduled to run each night to ensure the
documentation is up-to-date.

By utilizing this workflow, the project ensures that the Asciidoc documentation stays in sync with
the latest code changes. This leads to improved documentation quality and better project
understanding.
