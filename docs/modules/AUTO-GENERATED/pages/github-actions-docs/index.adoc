Github Actions workflows documentation is done inline using the documentation pattern from `link:https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc[shdoc]`. Although `shdoc` does not officially support `yml`-files, it still works because both file types use the same comment-style (`#`). However with `yml`-files it is only possible to document the whole file itself (since `yml` does not support functions like bash scripts). These docs pages describing Dockerfiles are auto-generated from a pipeline using `shdoc`.

link:https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows[Reusing workflows] avoids duplication. Rather than copying and pasting from one workflow to another, you can make workflows reusable. You and anyone with access to the reusable workflow can then call the reusable workflow from another workflow. This makes workflows easier to maintain and allows you to create new workflows more quickly by building on the work of others, just as you do with actions. Workflow reuse also promotes best practice by helping you to use workflows that are well designed, have already been tested, and have been proven to be effective. Your organization can build up a library of reusable workflows that can be centrally maintained.
