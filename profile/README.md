All contributions and changes should be linked to a corresponding issue or PR in the project board to ensure transparency and collaboration. See ["Task Management" in our Development Guide](https://github.com/sommerfeld-io/.github/blob/main/docs/development-guide.md#task-management) for detailed information.
