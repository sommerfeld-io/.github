## Official Distribution Channels

The sommerfeld.io organization and its associated projects are officially hosted on:

- GitHub: <https://github.com/sommerfeld-io> and GitHub Pages
- Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/u/sommerfeldio>

These are the only official sources for our source code, repositories, packages, artifacts, Docker images, and other data.

## Task Management

We use GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to track all tasks, todos, and code changes across our repositories. Task management is centralized in [a GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/sommerfeld-io/projects/1), which provides a clear overview of ongoing work, priorities, and progress. All contributions and changes should be linked to a corresponding issue or PR in the project board to ensure transparency and collaboration. See ["Task Management" in our Development Guide](https://github.com/sommerfeld-io/.github/blob/main/docs/development-guide.md#task-management) for detailed information.
