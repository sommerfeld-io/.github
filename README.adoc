== About this project
The `.github` repository serves as a central repository within GitHub that issue templates, GitHub Actions workflows, etc. for all our projects that don't have an actual .github directory with issue templates and other community health files on their own.

This project provides Reusable Workflows to use from other repositories. This avoids code duplications and removes the need for complex syncing mechanisms to keep every repo up to date.

Additionally this project provides Issue Templates and Pull Request Templates which are inherited from every other project of the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld.io GitHub organisation], because all of these projects do not define Issue Templates or Pull Request Templates on their own.

* Github Repository -> {url-project}
* Where to file issues -> {url-project}/issues

== How to use this project
Since this repo mainly is used for Reusable Workflows, see the the link:https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows[official docs from Github on Reusing Workflows] for general information.

=== Utilize Reusable Workflows from this repository
Within this repository, you will find three distinct reusable workflows that can be readily applied to streamline your development processes. These workflows are designed to enhance efficiency and provide concrete examples of how to leverage the power of automation in your projects.

==== Housekeeping: Issues
The workflow, that is called this way, handles the automatic assignment of newly created issues and pull requests to specific projects and users. By leveraging this workflow, tasks and contributions are efficiently tracked and assigned, ensuring clear ownership and streamlined collaboration within your development projects.

[source,yml]
----
include::ROOT:example$housekeeping-issues.yml[]
----

==== Housekeeping: Labels
The workflow, that is called this way, is responsible for deleting unnecessary labels and creating the required labels for issues and pull requests. By executing this workflow, it ensures a streamlined and organized labeling system, enabling effective categorization and tracking of tasks and contributions within your projects.

[source,yml]
----
include::ROOT:example$housekeeping-labels.yml[]
----

==== Housekeeping: Repo
The workflow, that is called this way, guarantees a consistent configuration of the repository itself by automating tasks such as enabling and disabling certain features (e.g., the wiki feature) or applying specific settings. This ensures that the repository maintains a standardized and controlled environment, aligning with the desired configuration.

== Risks and Technical Debts
link:{url-project}/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asecurity%2Crisk+is%3Aopen[All issus labeled as risk (= some sort of risk or a technical debt) or security (= related to security issues)] are tracked as Github issue and carry the respective label.
