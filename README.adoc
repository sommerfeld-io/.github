== About this project
The `.github` repository serves as a central repository within GitHub that issue templates, GitHub Actions workflows, etc. for all our projects that don't have an actual .github directory with issue templates and other community health files on their own.

This project provides Reusable Workflows to use from other repositories. This avoids code duplications and removes the need for complex syncing mechanisms to keep every repo up to date.

Additionally this project provides Issue Templates and Pull Request Templates which are inherited from every other project of the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld.io GitHub organisation], because all of these projects do not define Issue Templates or Pull Request Templates on their own.

* Github Repository -> {url-project}
* Where to file issues -> {url-project}/issues

== How to use this project
Since this repo mainly is used for Reusable Workflows, see the the link:https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows[official docs from Github on Reusing Workflows] for general information.

=== Houskeeping Workflows  that affect all Repositories
This repository serves as a centralized location for automated housekeeping workflows that apply to all repositories within the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld.io organisation].

One such workflow is the "Organization Housekeeping: Linter Rules" workflow. This workflow ensures uniformity by enforcing the use of the same set of linter rules (such as yamllint, shellcheck, etc.) and the same .gitignore file across all repositories. By centralizing these rules and configurations, we eliminate the need for each individual repository to manage and update them separately. This approach prevents inconsistencies and reduces the likelihood of outdated or inconsistent rule sets across our repositories.

=== Utilize Reusable Workflows from this repository
Within this repository, you will find three distinct reusable workflows that can be readily applied to streamline your development processes. These workflows are designed to enhance efficiency and provide concrete examples of how to leverage the power of automation in your projects.

==== Housekeeping: Issues
The workflow, that is called this way, handles the automatic assignment of newly created issues and pull requests to specific projects and users. By leveraging this workflow, tasks and contributions are efficiently tracked and assigned, ensuring clear ownership and streamlined collaboration within your development projects.

[source,yml]
----
include::ROOT:example$housekeeping-issues.yml[]
----

==== Housekeeping: Labels
The workflow, that is called this way, is responsible for deleting unnecessary labels and creating the required labels for issues and pull requests. By executing this workflow, it ensures a streamlined and organized labeling system, enabling effective categorization and tracking of tasks and contributions within your projects. Since the labels are managed through this workflow, the settings from link:https://github.com/organizations/sommerfeld-io/settings/repository-defaults[GitHub organizations label-config] don't take effect.

[source,yml]
----
include::ROOT:example$housekeeping-labels.yml[]
----

==== Housekeeping: Repo
The workflow, that is called this way, guarantees a consistent configuration of the repository itself by automating tasks such as enabling and disabling certain features (e.g., the wiki feature) or applying specific settings. This ensures that the repository maintains a standardized and controlled environment, aligning with the desired configuration.

[source,yml]
----
include::ROOT:example$housekeeping-repo.yml[]

==== Generate Docs (as Code)
This workflow automates the generation of the project's README.adoc file by extracting information from the Antora documentation of the repository. Additionally, it generates Asciidoc documentation into a dedicated Antora module for all bash scripts within the repository. All bash scripts must cmply to link:https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc[shdoc] documentation style. This automated process enhances consistency, accuracy, and readability of the project documentation, providing valuable insights and comprehensive information for users and contributors.

==== Module: CI Linter
This Reusable Workflow (`sommerfeld-io/.github/.github/workflows/module-ci-lint.yml`) serves as a module that offers essential linter functionalities which are common to all repositories. This module is designed to be called from other workflows and never runs independently within the `.github` repository. By including this reusable workflow in other workflows, developers can easily incorporate common linting capabilities into their specific workflows, promoting code quality and adherence to predefined standards. 

[source,yml]
----
# [...]
jobs:
  # [...]

  module-ci-lint:
    uses: sommerfeld-io/.github/.github/workflows/module-ci-lint.yml@main

  # [...]
----

There is no need to manage the linter rule sets on your own for each repository. The "Organization Housekeeping: Linter Rules" workflow guarantees that all required linter rule sets are present and up to date in every repository within the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld.io organisation] (see above). This streamlined approach eliminates the burden of manually managing and updating rule sets in individual repositories, saving time and promoting code consistency.

=== More Modules
In addition to the aforementioned Reusable Workflow module, there are other modules available within the repository. These modules can be similarly utilized by calling them from other workflows. For an overview of available modules, please visit https://github.com/sommerfeld-io/.github/tree/main/.github/workflows.
