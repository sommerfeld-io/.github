== About this project
The `.github` repository serves as a central repository within GitHub that issue templates, GitHub Actions workflows, etc. for all our projects that don't have an actual .github directory with issue templates and other community health files on their own.

Additionally this project provides Reusable Workflows to use from other repositories. This avoids code duplications and removes the need for complex syncing mechanisms to keep every repo up to date.

== How to use this project
Since this repo mainly is used for Reusable Workflows, the link:https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows[official docs from Github on Reusing Workflows] is all you need.
