:zap: As a _role_ I can _capability_, so that _receive benefit_.

### Acceptance Criteria (executable specification)
:zap: Write the Acceptance Criteria ... The Scenarios names are pointing in the right direction, but are nowhere near ready for implementation.
```gherkin
Feature: todo ...

  As a _role_ I can _capability_, so that _receive benefit_.

  Background:
    Given todo ...

  Scenario: todo ...
    Given todo ...
    When todo ...
    Then todo ...
```

### Acceptance Criteria (additional / manual)
:zap: Memo (remove when story is ready)
- [ ] :zap: Translate the user story into executable specifications
    - :zap: If you cannot think about phrasing these tests, check if you really understand the problem
    - :zap: Use ubiquitous language based on the language of the problem domain
    - :zap: When a dedicated file from the code repository is used to define the acceptance criteria, do not repeat here. Just link to the proper definitions

### Post-Implementation Tasks (Examples)
- [ ] :zap: Measure _related metric_ after implementation for _period of time_.
- [ ] :zap: Track the reduction in _related metric_ related to the feature for _period of time_.
